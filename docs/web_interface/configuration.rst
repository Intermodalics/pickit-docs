=============

-  `Loading a setup or product file <#loading>`__
-  `Creating a setup or product file <#creating>`__

On the configuration page, you can manage the setup and product files on
your Pick-it system.

-  **Setup** file: contains the Region of Interest (ROI) configuration,
   the camera selection, and the robot type.
-  **Product** file: contains the detection and picking parameters for a
   specific product.

The current loaded setup and product file are always shown in the top
bar as shown in the screenshot below.

Setup and product files can also be loaded from within your robot
program using the correct Pick-it command.

Creating a new setup or product file
------------------------------------

To create a new setup and product file, fill in the corresponding text
fields and click the  **Create** button. Pick-it will make a copy of the
current loaded setup and product and store them under the new name.
After creation, the new setup and product file will automatically be
loaded.

**Note** Setup and product properties can only be saved to the current
configuration. Therefore, a new setup and/or product should be created
or loaded **before** starting to configure a Pick-it application.
