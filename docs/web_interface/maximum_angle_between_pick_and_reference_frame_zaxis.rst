Maximum angle between pick and reference frame Z-axis
=====================================================

With this setting, you can specify the maximum angular difference
between the Z axis of your pick frame and the Z axis of your reference
frame. As seen in the image below, if an object is tilted more than the
maximum specified angle, the object will be labeled as unpickable and
not sent to the robot. In the Pick-it web interface, unpickable objects
are displayed orange in the Objects view and the Â `detection
grid <https://support.pickit3d.com/article/167-the-pick-it-detection-grid>`__.
