What can I do if Pickit cannot detect the parts with enough accuracy?
=====================================================================

For these application often a 2-step program is introduced.
The idea of this is to first pick a part and isolate it.
In the first step the correct orientation or the accuracy is not assumed to be important.
Once the part is isolated Pickit can look again to find the part with higher accuracy.

A good example of this, is discussed in the following article: :ref:`example-random-boxes`.
