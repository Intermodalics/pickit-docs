What can I do if Pickit cannot detect the parts with enough accuracy?
=====================================================================

For these applications often a two-step detection is used.
The idea of this is to first pick a part and isolate it.
In the first step, the correct orientation or accuracy is not assumed to be important.
Once the part is isolated, Pickit can look again to find the part with higher accuracy.

A good example of this is discussed in the following article: :ref:`example-random-boxes`.
