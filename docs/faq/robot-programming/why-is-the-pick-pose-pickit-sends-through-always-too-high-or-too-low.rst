Why is the pick pose Pickit sends through always too high or too low?
======================================================================

In most cases this is related to a wrong definition of the pick point in Pickit or the tool center point (TCP) of the robot.

You can find more information on defining the pick point in Pickit here: :ref:`pick-points`.

You can find more information on defining the TCP here:Â :ref:`Defining-tcp-universal-robots`
