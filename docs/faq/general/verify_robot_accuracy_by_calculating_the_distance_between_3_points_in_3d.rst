How to verify the robot accuracy by calculating the distance between 3 points in 3D
===================================================================================

This articles discribes an easy way to verify the accuracy of a robot.

First try to get your hands on 2 `A4 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size#/media/File:A_size_illustration2.svg>`__ sheets or 1 \ `A3 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size#/media/File:A_size_illustration2.svg>`__ sheet. In case of two A4 sheets make sure you attach them accurately and firm to each other as seen in the illustration below.

Lay this paper in such a way that the whole paper is in reach of your robot.

Now point your robot exactly to point A, B and C and on every point write down the coordinates given to you by the robot.

Then calculate the distance between:

-  A and B
-  B and C
-  A and C

by using  `this calculator <http://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/geometry-solids/distance-two-points.php>`__.

Normally the three distance should resemble:

-  A and B: 297 mm
-  B and C: 420 mm
-  A and C: 514.4 mm

**If this is not the case, there is something wrong with the accuracy of the robot.** In that case further refinement of the Pickit calibration will not lead to a beter accuracy.

If this is the case: Good news! There is no indication that there is something wrong with the accuracy of your robot.
