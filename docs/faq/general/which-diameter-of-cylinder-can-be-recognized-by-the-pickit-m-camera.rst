Which size of cylinder can be recognised by the Pickit M camera?
================================================================

As discussed in the article :ref:`what-is-the-ideal-distance-to-mount-the-pickit-camera`, the closer the camera is mounted to the scene the more details can be found.
The graph below shows which cylinder diameter can be reliably detected at which distance with a Pickit M camera.
Everything above the green line is considered to be within Pickit's comfort zone.
From this graph again it can be noted that the closer the camera is mounted the smaller diameters can be detected.
But the closer the camera is mounted also means a smaller field of view.
