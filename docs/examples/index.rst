  In each **Build a showcase demo** articles, a snapshot of the scene is provided. This snapshot shows recommended settings for that specific application, and you are welcome to use them as a starting point in your own showcase application. In order to retrieve the product file of a snapshot, follow these steps:

  #. Open the snapshot.
  #. Go to the **Detection** or **Picking** page.
  #. Click the :guilabel:`Save as` button on the top of the page.
  #. Name the new file and press :guilabel:`Continue`.

  You can also retrieve the setup file by following similar actions, but in the **Setup** page instead.
