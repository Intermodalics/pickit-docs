This exercise consist of three different parts. To get feedback on all
different parts of the exercise in total three different snapshots need
to be created.

-  Detect the cardboard boxes with dimensions 114mm x 64mm.

of the clusters are well defined. This means that the clustering method,
contour method and downsampling influence the performance.
