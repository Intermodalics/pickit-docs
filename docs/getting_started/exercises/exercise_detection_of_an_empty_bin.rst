Task
----

Three bins are shown beneath the camera: one that is still rather full,
one completely empty and the last one is almost empty. Your task is to
create a detection strategy that detects if a bin is (almost) empty.

**Given:** Region of Interest settings for each box.

-  Bin 1: X 10 - 160mm, Y -10 - 260 mm, Z 5 - 140 mm.
-  Bin 2: X 220 - 370mm, Y -10 - 260mm, Z 5 - 140mm.
-  Bin 3: X 420 - 570mm, Y -10 - 260mm, Z 5 - 140mm.

**Hint:** No object detection could indicate an empty bin.
