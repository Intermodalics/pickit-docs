Your first pick
===============

The last step in this getting started guide is creating a robot program
to do your first pick with Pickit.Â 

-  In the :ref:`Pickit web interface <web-interface>`, make sure robot mode is
   enabled. If not, press :guilabel:`Enable Robot Mode` on the
   :ref:`top bar <web-interface-top-bar>`.
-  On your robot open the example picking program supplied by Pickit.
-  Define the correct Tool Center Point for the robot tool.
-  In the robot program select the Test\_Pickit product and setup files.
-  Define the start and drop off position for the robot.
-  Add object grasping logic.
-  Start picking!
