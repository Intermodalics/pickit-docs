Testing your setup
==================

To verify that you have correctly set up your Pickit system, there are two
things you can check for:

#. You can successfully connect to the Pickit web interface from an external computer.

   -  Open a :ref:`supported web browser <supported-browsers>` on your external PC and enter http://192.168.66.1 in the address bar.
   -  Now the Pickit user interface is visible inside your web browser.

#. Pickit can successfully reach the IP address of the robot:

   -  From the top bar of the web interface, navigate to the :guilabel:`Settings` page, under **Pickit port labeled 'ROBOT'**.
   -  Insert the **IP address of your robot** in the Robot IP field and press :guilabel:`Check`.
