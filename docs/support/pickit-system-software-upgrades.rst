.. warning:: We noticed that in some cases the web interface can show the error
   message **ERROR: Something went wrong during upgrading** although the upgrade
   process is still running fine. We are working hard on resolving this confusion.
   **DO NOT REBOOT THE PICKIT SYSTEM YOURSELF AND WAIT FOR IT TO REBOOT
   AUTOMATICALLY.** Once the Pickit system rebooted, the web interface will also
   automatically refresh and show the newest version. In the exceptional case that
   the Pickit system does not reboot itself within 15 minutes after starting the
   upgrade, please contact support@pickit3d.com if you can't confirm that the
   upgrade succeeded.
