Connecting to Pickit via USB dongle
-----------------------------------

.. warning::
  This section refers to a method to bring a Pickit system online that is not supported since April 2020.
  Pickit systems shipped before this date came with a USB 3G dongle, which is no longer active.
  Pickit systems shipped after this date don't come with a USB 3G dongle.

  If your system has a deactivated 3G dongle, you should disconnect it from the Pickit processor, otherwise :ref:`wired LAN connections <connect-your-system-to-internet>` won't work.

.. note:: Since this is a wireless device, it's important that it is
   positioned **outside a metal enclosure** (Faraday cage). In case your
   Pickit system is in such an enclosure, you may use an extension cable
   up to 2 m to install the remote service modem outside this enclosure.

   Depending on **3G reception on site**, a Pickit support
   engineer could view and manipulate the Pickit web interface, install
   product and or setup files and perform updates. If the mobile reception
   is bad, viewing and manipulating the interface could be impossible. On
   slow connections, software updates can take up to several hours.

The USB 3G dongle is meant for bringing a Pickit system online.
A Pickit SIM card is already inside so this works out of the box.
Pickit systems were shipped with two different types of USB 3G dongles,
use the images below as a reference to check which type of dongle came
with your Pickit system.

Type 1
~~~~~~

Pickit system. No configuration is required.
