Task
----

This exercise consist of three different parts. To get feedback on all
different parts of the exercise in total three different snapshots need
to be created.

-  Detect the cardboard boxes with dimensions 114mm x 64mm.
-  Detect the coils with outer diameter 55mm.
-  Detect the coils with inner diameter 23mm.

**Hint:** When using Pickit Pattern, it is important that the contours
of the clusters are well defined. This means that the clustering method,
contour method and downsampling influence the performance.
