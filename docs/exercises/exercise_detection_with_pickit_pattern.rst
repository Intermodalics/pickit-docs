Before starting on this exercise we advise you to read following articles:

-  :ref:`Region of Interest <region-of-interest>`
-  :ref:`Detection: Pickit Pattern <Pattern>`

Task
----

This exercise consist of three different parts. To get feedback on all
different parts of the exercise in total three different snapshots need
to be created.

-  Detect the cardboard boxes with dimensions 114 mm x 64 mm.
-  Detect the coils with outer diameter 55 mm.
-  Detect the coils with inner diameter 23 mm.

**Hint:** When using Pickit Pattern, it is important that the contours
of the clusters are well defined. This means that the clustering method,
contour method and downsampling influence the performance.
