Testing your setup
==================

Connecting to the Pick-it web interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you connected your computer directly to the Pick-it processor you can
now connect to the Pick-it interface by surfing to  http://192.168.66.1
to configure your Pick-it setup.

If you connected the Pick-it processor to your network you can now
connect to the Pick-it interface by surfing to the IP address that was
assigned by the DHCP server of your network.

If you still have questions regarding the connection to the Pick-it web
interface you can always contact 
`support@pickit3d.com <mailto:mailto:support@pickit3d.com>`__.

Testing the Robot to Pick-it connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To test if Pick-it can connect to the robot through the Ethernet cable
you can perform the following test:

#. Press the **Settings** button on the top of the Pick-it interface;
#. Insert the **IP address of your robot** in the Robot IP field;
#. Push **Check**

A pop-up message indicating failure or **success** appears on the lower
right corner of the screen.

.. note::
  In case of failure, check if the cables are properly connected and
  whether the IP assigned to the robot during the IP configuration step
  matches the tested one.
