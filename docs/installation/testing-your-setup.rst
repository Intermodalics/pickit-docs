Testing your setup
==================

To verify that you have correctly set up your Pickit system, there are two
things you can check for:

#. You can successfully :ref:`connect to the Pickit web interface <connecting-to-the-web-interface>`
   from an external computer.
#. Pickit can successfully reach the IP address of the robot:

   - From the :ref:`top bar <web-interface-top-bar>` of the web interface,
     navigate to the :guilabel:`Settings` page, under **Pickit port labeled 'ROBOT'**.
   - :ref:`Test the robot to Pickit connection <test-robot-connection>`.

If the above steps work as expected, you're ready to go, happy picking!
Else, if one of the steps did not work as expected, please contact us at
`support@pickit3d.com <mailto:mailto:support@pickit3d.com>`__ and we'll help you
figure out what's going on.
