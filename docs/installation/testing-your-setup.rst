Testing your setup
==================

Connecting to the Pickit web interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you connected your computer directly to the Pickit processor you can
now connect to the Pickit interface by surfing to  http://192.168.66.1
to configure your Pickit setup.

If you connected the Pickit processor to your network you can now
connect to the Pickit interface by surfing to the IP address that was
assigned by the DHCP server of your network.

If you still have questions regarding the connection to the Pickit web
interface you can always contact 
`support@pickit3d.com <mailto:mailto:support@pickit3d.com>`__.

Testing the Robot to Pickit connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To test if Pickit can connect to the robot through the Ethernet cable
you can perform the following test:

#. Press the **Settings** button on the top of the Pickit interface;
#. Insert the **IP address of your robot** in the Robot IP field;
#. Push **Check**

A pop-up message indicating failure or **success** appears on the lower
right corner of the screen.

  In case of failure, check if the cables are properly connected and
  whether the IP assigned to the robot during the IP configuration step
  matches the tested one.
