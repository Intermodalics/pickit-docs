.. note::
  If you want to perform calibration once or infrequently, you don't need to use this example program.
  You can teach the calibration poses manually using the pendant and the :ref:`Collect current pose <multi-poses-calibration-collect-current-pose>` in the calibration wizard of the Pickit web interface.
