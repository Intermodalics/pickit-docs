The Pickit Omron TM interface
=============================

Pickit integrates seamlessly with **Omron TM** cobots by means of a set of **TMflow components**.
Each component is a building block for creating vision-guided applications with Pickit.
This article documents the interface of the Pickit TM Components.
For installation instructions please refer to the Omron TM :ref:`techman-installation` article.

Components
----------

Pickit provides a set of components that add to the set of existing TM nodes.
This section describes the purpose of each component, the meaning of the input parameters (if any), as well as that of the output gateway states.

To insert a component instance into your robot program, click on one of the Pickit components listed on the left panel and drag it into your program. This is how Pickit components look like:

    :scale: 100%
    :align: center

.. note::
  The naming convention for TMflow components is
  ``Application_Provider_Vendor_Version_Function``, which for Pickit corresponds to
  ``perception_pickit_pickit_Vxx_Function``.
  Pickit components only differ on the ``Function`` name, so throughout this article the common prefix is omitted for brevity.

A general note on introspecting component behavior is that the ``g_perception_pickit_user_msg`` global variable holds human-readable status updates from all components.
For instance, when a component exists with an error state, the value of this variable can be shown in a **Display** node to get an insight on the failure reason.
Refer to the :ref:`pick and place example <techman-main-program>` for the recommended usage.

.. _tm-init:

init
~~~~

Initializes the connection with a Pickit system and handles communications with it.
It should be the first Pickit component to appear in a robot program.

**Parameters**

- **Pickit IP address:** It can be modified by editing the ``perception_pickit_pickit_V01_init1_pickit`` device of the internal ``send`` node:

.. image:: /assets/images/robot-integrations/techman/tm-init-2.png
   :scale: 40 %
   :align: center

**Output**

``OK`` if robot mode has been enabled, ``ROBOT_MODE_DISABLED`` otherwise.
Robot mode is enabled in the Pickit web interface, and is a requisite for performing picking operations, but not robot-camera calibration.

.. _tm-configure:

configure
~~~~~~~~~

Loads a specified setup and product configuration.
This specifies the behavior of Pickit detections, i.e. where and what to look for.

**Parameters**

- **Setup and product ID:** Available configurations are listed in the :ref:`Pickit web interface <web-interface>`.

By default, the IDs correspond to invalid values, so it is required to edit these parameters.

.. image:: /assets/images/robot-integrations/techman/tm-configure-1.png
   :scale: 40 %
   :align: center

**Output**

``OK`` if the requested configuration was successfully loaded, ``FAIL`` otherwise.
The most typical failure reason is specifying non-existent IDs.

.. _tm-findobjects:

findObjects
~~~~~~~~~~~

Trigger a Pickit object detection using the currently active setup and product configuration.

The next Pickit component after **findObjects** should always be **getResult**, which waits until a response for the detection request is ready.

.. tip:: It’s valid (and sometimes encouraged) to perform robot motions or other non Pickit actions between calls to **findObjects** and **getResult**.
  For instance refer to the :ref:`techman-pick-and-place-program` for such an application.

**Parameters**

This component has no input parameters.

**Output**

``OK`` if the object detection was successfully triggered, ``FAIL`` otherwise.

   :scale: 45 %
   :align: center

nextObject
~~~~~~~~~~

Request the next detected object.

A single call to **findObjects** might yield the detection of multiple objects.
**nextObject** allows to request the next available object, if any, without the need of triggering a new detection and the time overhead it entails.

The next Pickit component after **nextObject** should always be **getResult**, which waits until a response for the request is ready.

.. tip:: It’s recommended to use this component only when objects in the detection region have not moved (significantly) since calling **findObjects**.
  A good example of when to use **nextObject** is when a detection is unreachable by the robot.

**Parameters**

This component has no input parameters.

**Output**

``OK`` if there is a next detected object, ``FAIL`` if the set of detected objects has been exhausted.

.. _tm-getresult:

getResult
~~~~~~~~~

Wait for Pickit reply with detection results.
This should always be the next Pickit component after a **findObjects** or **getNextObject** request.
It blocks the robot until a reply from Pickit is received.
When an object has been found, the following global variables are populated:

-  ``g_percepton_pickit_pose`` Object pick pose.
-  ``g_percepton_pickit_dim`` Object dimensions.
-  ``g_percepton_pickit_type`` Object type.
-  ``g_percepton_pickit_remaining_obj`` Number of remaining object detections from the last call to **findObjects**.
   After first calling **getResult**, this variable contains the total number of object detections minus one.
   This value is also equal to the number of times **getNextObject** can be called.
   As such, the value decreases with each call to **getNextObject**.

**Parameters**

This component has no input parameters.

**Output**

Pickit can discriminate the following scenarios, for which the robot program can take action upon:

- ``OBJECT_FOUND``: A valid object has been found.
- ``NO_OBJECT_FOUND``: There are no pickable objects, yet the Region Of Interest (ROI) is not empty.
- ``EMPTY_ROI``: There are no pickable objects because the ROI is empty.
- ``NO_IMAGE_CAPTURED``: Image capture failed, most probably due to a disconnected camera.
- ``FAIL``: The call to **getResult** failed, for instance because it was called at the wrong place (not the next Pickit component after a **findObjects** or **getNextObject** request).

.. image:: /assets/images/robot-integrations/techman/tm-getresult-1.png

.. warning:: As of version 1.72 of TMflow, it is not possible to programmatically check if a pose is reachable by the robot before it gets executed.
  It is currently recommended that end users focus on applications in which parts are known to be always reachable.
  When parts can overlap, as in bin picking scenarios, the methods below help in making sure that objects are reachable.

  - For suction and magnetic grippers that exhibit compliant behavior, enforce :ref:`pick points with the z-axis pointing up <enforce-alignment-z-parallel-z>`. This constraint modifies the pick point orientation such that the tool always approaches the part straight down. This can be set in the **Picking** tab, under **Pick strategy**.

  - For fingered grippers, ignore parts that are :ref:`too tilted wit respect to the reference frame Z-axis <max_angle_pick_z_ref_z>`. This setting is also in the **Picking** tab, under **Collision prevention**. Set the maximum angle to a low value such as 15 degrees.

saveSnapshot
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Save a snapshot with the latest detection results.
The saved snapshot can then be loaded or downloaded by going to the :ref:`Snapshots` page on the Pickit web interface and searching for a file whose name contains the capture timestamp.

**Parameters**

This component has no input parameters.

**Output**

``OK`` if the snapshot was successfully saved, ``FAIL`` otherwise.

.. _tm-find-calibration-plate:

findCalibrationPlate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Trigger detection of the robot-camera calibration plate.
This component requires the Pickit web interface to be in the :ref:`robot-camera-calibration` page.

This component is meant to be used only in robot-camera calibration programs such as the :ref:`techman-calibration-program`.
It is not meant to be used in picking programs.

**Parameters**

This component has no input parameters.

**Output**

``OK`` if the calibration plate was found, ``FAIL`` otherwise.

buildBackground
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Build background cloud used by some :ref:`advanced Region of Interest filters <advanced-roi-filters>`.
This is an advanced feature, rarely triggered from the robot program in practice.

**Parameters**

This component has no input parameters.

**Output**

``OK`` if the background cloud was built, ``FAIL`` otherwise.
