Fanuc Pickit support
====================

The best way to receive support with Pickit on Fanuc robot is to share a file backup of your Fanuc robot to Pickit support.
That way, we at Pickit can reproduce your setup in Fanuc simulation.

To create a file backup, you can follow these `instructions <https://help.dragandbot.com/hardware/robots/fanuc/03_backup_restore.html#file-backup>`__.
