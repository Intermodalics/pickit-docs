.. attention::
   Before running the robot program for the first time, make sure that:

   - There exists a valid :ref:`robot-camera calibration <robot-camera-calibration>`.
   - The **Tool Center Point (TCP)** has been correctly specified.
   - The **robot speed** is set to a low value, so unexpected behavior can be identified early enough to prevent the robot from colliding with people or the environment.
   - Pickit is in **robot mode**, which is enabled in the :ref:`Pickit web interface <web-interface-top-bar>`.
