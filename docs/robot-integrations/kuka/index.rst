Check controller and software compatibility
-------------------------------------------

Pickit is compatible with controllers as of version **KR-C4** and the software module **KUKA Connect KRC** for socket communication is required. The product number for this module is **91B300-020** version **2.0.14** or later.

.. tip::
   This module can only be purchased through Pickit. Please contact your account manager or sales@pickit3d.com for more information.

Verify if already installed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To verify whether the **KUKA Connect KRC** module is already installedon the **KR-C4** controller, go to the **Main Menu**, then :guilabel:`Help` > :guilabel:`Info`. In the **Info** screen select the :guilabel:`Options` tab. The **Main Menu** is reachable by clicking on the round robot icon:

If an entry named **Connect** is listed, then the module is installed and you can skip the next subsection. If the entry is not listed, as in the image below (right), follow the remaining steps of this section to install the **KUKA Connect KRC** module.

Module installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **KUKA Connect KRC** module can be purchased directly from KUKA, and consists of: a set of files that you should copy to a NTFS formatted USB drive, and a 16-digit license key with the format **xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx** that depends on the robot’s serial number.

Generation of temporary license keys by KUKA is possible for validating an application before the actual purchase of a Pickit system.

Plug in the USB drive containing the **KUKA Connect KRC** module files in the external USB port of the **KR-C4** controller cabinet.

A user with expert privileges is required to install the module. To enable expert mode, go to **Main Menu**, then :guilabel:`Configuration` > :guilabel:`User group` and select the :guilabel:`Expert` group.

.. image:: /assets/images/robot-integrations/kuka/kuka-step-3.png

To install the module, go to **Main Menu**, then :guilabel:`Start-up` > :guilabel:`Additional software`. On the **Additional software** click the :guilabel:`New software` button at the bottom left.

.. image:: /assets/images/robot-integrations/kuka/kuka-step-4.png

You should see a list of available modules pending for installation, including an entry named **Connect**. Toggle the checkbox next to the **Connect** module and click install. Confirm the installation on the pop-up dialog.

.. image:: /assets/images/robot-integrations/kuka/kuka-step-5.png

After preparing the installation, a pop-up dialog will request a controller restart to complete the installation. Dismiss the pop-up by clicking :guilabel:`OK` and click the :guilabel:`Restart` button. You can also remove the USB drive from the **KR-C4** controller cabinet at this point.

After restarting, you should see a notification at the top of the screen indicating that the **Connect** module has an invalid license key.

.. image:: /assets/images/robot-integrations/kuka/kuka-step-7.png

To activate the license, go to **Main Menu**, then :guilabel:`Configuration` > :guilabel:`Connect settings`. In the **Connect settings** screen click the :guilabel:`License` button.

.. image:: /assets/images/robot-integrations/kuka/kuka-step-8.png

Enter the 16 digit license key associated to the robot’s serial number **including dashes** and click :guilabel:`Activate`.

.. image:: /assets/images/robot-integrations/kuka/kuka-step-9.png

For the license key activation to take effect, another controller restart is required. To do so, go to **Main Menu**, then :guilabel:`Shutdown`. In the **Shutdown** screen click the :guilabel:`Reboot control PC` button and confirm.

SPS file settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Apart from installing the **KUKA Connect KRC** module, it is necessary to add one command to the SPS file, which executes in the background of all robot programs. You need to be in **expert** mode to perform this operation. 

To open the SPS file from the navigator, browse to :guilabel:`R1` > :guilabel:`System`, select the **sps** file and click :guilabel:`Open`, as shown in the figure below, left.

Once the file is open, move the cursor to the **USER PLC** line and click on :guilabel:`Open/close fold`, and add a line calling the ``pickitsps()`` function, as shown in the figure below, right. Finally, close the file to save and exit (orange close icon at left panel).

.. image:: /assets/images/robot-integrations/kuka/kuka-close-icon.png

The ``pickitsps()`` function allows Pickit to have access to the robot flange pose, as opposed to the pose of the currently active tool.

KUKA KRC settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that the **KUKA Connect KRC** module is installed, we need to configure it to communicate correctly with the Pickit system. To do this, go to **Main Menu**, then :guilabel:`Configuration` > :guilabel:`Connect settings`. In the **Connect settings** screen select the :guilabel:`Pickit settings` tab and inspect/modify the configuration, as follows, and as shown in the figure below (right):

.. image:: /assets/images/robot-integrations/kuka/kuka-step-12.png

-  **Check correctness the robot IP address.**
   This is a read-only value shown for sanity-checking the robot configuration. If you wish to change the robot IP address, please refer to the **KUKA KR-C4** user manual.
-  **Disable the local UDP port.**
-  **Disable the local TCP port.**
-  **Activate ‘Show dialogs to autocomplete filter’.**
-  **Activate ‘Enable PickIt client connection’.**
-  **Specify the Pickit server IP address.**

When communicating with KUKA robots, the Pickit server IP address cannot belong to the following IP ranges:

- 169.254.0.0 to 169.254.255.255
- 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.0.255
- 172.16.0.0 to 172.16.255.255
- 172.17.0.0 to 172.17.255.255
  
The default Pickit server IP is **169.254.5.180**, which belongs to the first range, so it must be modified.

Click on the :guilabel:`Save` button to store the settings.

Setting up the network connection
---------------------------------

The Pickit processor has to be connected to the **KUKA KR-C4** controller using an Ethernet cable. This Ethernet cable should connect:

- The network port labeled **ROBOT** of the Pickit processor
- The KLI Ethernet port of the KR-C4 controller (also referred to as X66). The location of this port may vary depending on the controller model. The below images show example locations: Cabinet door (left), built-in switch (right).

Loading the program files
-------------------------

There are two sets of files installed in the robot controller that
relate to Pickit communication:

-  **Pickit application files.**
   These are example programs that illustrate how to perform typical Pickit operations, like robot camera calibration or object detection for pick and place.These are located in :guilabel:`R1` > :guilabel:`Progran` > :guilabel:`Pickit`.
-  **Pickit interface files.**
   These are internal files that expose the high-level functions used by the application files, and manage low-level communication with the Pickit system. These files are not meant for editing and are located in :guilabel:`R1` > :guilabel:`TP` > :guilabel:`Connect` > :guilabel:`Pickit`.

The Pickit application files can be loaded and executed as any other KUKA.KRL program. Please refer to the **KUKA KR-C4** user manual for further details.

The examples contained in the Pickit application files contain **hard-coded robot poses that should be adapted to every new robot**. When executing such programs for the first time, please do so in **manual mode and at low speed** to check for potential collisions.

Starting and verifying the communication
----------------------------------------

Before starting the communication, on the Pickit interface select KUKA as the robot to communicate with. Next, on the robot side, go to **Main Menu**, then :guilabel:`Configuration` > :guilabel:`Connect settings`. In the **Connect settings** screen, data being exchanged between the robot and Pickit is displayed in the text boxes labeled **PC -> Robot** and **Robot -> PC**. You should see data and timestamps be updated multiple times per second.

Details on testing this connection on the Pickit side can be found on: :ref:`test-robot-connection`.
