.. _urcap-global-variables:

Global variables
----------------

To use one of the global variables defined by the Pickit plugin, you need to declare it in the **BeforeStart** section of the program. You only need to declare the variables you actually use in your program.

.. _pick_pose:

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **pickit_pose**                                                          |
+==========================================================================+
| Pick pose for the latest detection results sent by Pickit, represented   |
| as a 6D array. The sequence of commands to get a valid and reachable     |
| pick pose is:                                                            |
|                                                                          |
| #. Declare the variable in the **BeforeStart** section of the            |
|    program.                                                              |

| #. In the **Robot Program** section, send a request to Pickit            |
|    using **Find object(s)** or **Get next object** command.              |
| #. Wait for detection result using **Get Result** command.               |
| #. Check that a valid detection is available by                          |
|    calling ``pickit_object_found()``.                                    |
| #. Check that the robot can reach the pose by                            |
|    calling ``pickit_object_reachable()``.                                |
|                                                                          |

+================================================================================================+
| Pre-pick pose for the latest detection results sent by Pickit, represented as a 6D array.      |
| The sequence of commands to get a valid and reachable pre-pick pose is the same as for         |
| ``pickit_pose``. Refer to the documentation of ``pickit_pose`` for more details. For details   |
| on how ``pickit_pre_pose`` is computed from ``pickit_pose``, refer to the documentation of the |
| **Get result** command.                                                                        |

| where ``bbox x`` means the size of the bounding box along the            |
| x-axis.                                                                  |

| -  If robot mode is enabled, program execution continues                 |
| -  If robot mode is not enabled, a pop-up is shown requesting the user   |
|    to set Pickit to robot mode.                                          |
|                                                                          |
| Except for **Find calibration plate**, all other Pickit plugin commands  |

| **Find object(s)**                                                       |
+==========================================================================+
| Trigger a Pickit object detection using the currently active setup and   |
| product configuration.                                                   |
|                                                                          |
| The next Pickit command after **Find object(s)** should always be        |
| **Get result**, which waits until a response for the detection request   |
| is ready.                                                                |

| Note that it's valid (and sometimes encouraged) to perform robot motions |
| or other non Pickit actions between calls to **Find object(s)** and      |
| **Get result**, for instance.                                            |
|                                                                          |

| Refer to the cycle time optimization section of the                      |
| :ref:`universal-robots-urcap-example` article for the motivation behind  |

.. _command-get-next-object:

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Get next object**                                                      |
+==========================================================================+
| Request the next detected object.                                        |
|                                                                          |
| A single call to **Find object(s)** might yield the detection of         |
| multiple objects. **Get next object** allows to request the next         |
| available object, if any, without the need of triggering a new detection |
| and the time overhead it entails.                                        |
|                                                                          |
| The next Pickit command after  **Find object(s)** should always          |
| be **Get next object**, which waits until a response for the request     |
| is ready.                                                                |
|                                                                          |
|    .. image:: /assets/images/robot-integrations/ur/urcap-next-1.png      |
|                                                                          |
| It's recommended to use this command only when objects in the            |
| detection region have not moved (significantly) since calling            |
| **Find object(s)**. A good example of when to use **Get next object** is |
| when a detection is unreachable by the robot. An example of when using   |
| **Get next object** is not ideal would be the following bin picking      |
| scenario:                                                                |
|                                                                          |
| -  Trigger Pickit detection that finds multiple objects.                 |
| -  First object is picked. Since objects are randomly placed in bin,     |
|    neighboring objects move and fall into place.                         |
| -  Call **Get next object** and attempt to pick next object. If the next |
|    object is one of the neighboring parts that moved, the pick might     |
|    fail.                                                                 |
|                                                                          |
| When the objects in the detection region have moved, it's better to      |
| re-trigger  **Find object(s)** instead.                                  |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

.. _command-get-result:

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Get result**                                                           |
+==========================================================================+
| Wait for Pickit reply with detection results.                            |
| **Get result** should always be the next Pickit command after            |
| a **Find object(s)** or **Get next object** request. It blocks until a   |
| reply from Pickit is received, and the success of the request can then   |
| be queried by calling ``pickit_object_found()``. When an object has      |

Helper functions
----------------

As opposed to commands, that don't have a return value; the Pickit plugin also exposes a number of helper functions that return useful information. They typically are used as the expression of a conditional, such as an ``if`` statement, and can be selected from the **available functions drop-down**.
