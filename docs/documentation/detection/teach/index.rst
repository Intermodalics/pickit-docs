Teach
=====

Pickit Teach is a detection engine that works in 2 steps:

1. **Teach a model**: Show an object to the camera or directly upload its CAD file to teach its shape.
2. **Detect the object(s)**: Pickit will then look for similar shaped objects in a new scene.

In the image below, first a single socket was shown to the Pickit system, next similar shaped sockets are found in the bin.
