Teach
=====

Pickit Teach is a detection engine that works in 2 steps. 
First you show an object to the camera and Pickit remembers the shape. 
Next Pickit will look for similar shaped objects in a new scene. 
In the image below, first a single bottle was shown to the Pickit system, next similar shaped bottles are found in the bin.
