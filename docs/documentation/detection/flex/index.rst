====

The Pickit Flex engine easily finds geometric shapes in 3D (cylinders and spheres) and 2D (squares, rectangles, circles and ellipses), and can handle a variety of sizes with a single configuration.

In the image below, an example Flex detection is shown. Here Pickit finds all cylindrical shapes in the bin.

.. note::
  For applications with cylindrical objects of known dimensions, :ref:`Teach with Cylinder model <teach-cylinder>` is the recommended engine.
