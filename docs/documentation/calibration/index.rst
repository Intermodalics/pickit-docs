Robot camera calibration
------------------------

Robot camera calibration is the process where the camera and the robot learn their relative position towards each other. 
If done correctly, the camera can guide the robot to correct positions in the physical environment. 
Once the camera and robot are mounted, calibration can be done. 
This process only needs to be repeated if the camera is moved relative to the robot base, or visa versa.
