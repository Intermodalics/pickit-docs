Robot camera calibration
------------------------

Robot camera calibration is the process where the camera and the robot learn their relative position
with respect to each other. If done correctly, the camera can guide the robot to correct positions in
the physical environment. Calibration can be performed once the camera and robot have been mounted in
the work cell. This process only needs to be repeated if the camera is moved relative to the robot base,
or vice-versa.
