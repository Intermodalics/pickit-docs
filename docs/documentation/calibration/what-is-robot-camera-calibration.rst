What is robot camera calibration?
=================================

Robot camera calibration is the process where the camera and the robot
learn their relative position towards each other. If done correctly, the
camera can guide the robot to correct positions in the physical
environment. 

Once the camera and robot are mounted, calibration can be done. This
process only needs to be repeated if the the camera is moved relative
to the robot, or visa versa.
