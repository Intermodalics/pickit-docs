How to use Pickit Flex
----------------------

The Pickit Flex detection engine has a typical workflow, which
is described step by step in this article.

Define the 3D scene
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first step of Pickit Flex is to define where the Pickit system
should look. The 3D scene is defined by a Region of Interest and the
detection optimization parameters (explained in article :ref:`Explaining-the-flex-detection-parameters`).

In the image below an example of a good defined scene is shown. First,
in the 3D view all points within the field of view of the camera are
shown. Second, in the Points view only the points of the parts in the
bin are shown. The table and the bin are filtered out. Also it can be
seen that the space in between points have gotten bigger in the second
view. 

The information shown in the Points view is what will be transferred to
the next step. All other information is not taken into account for the
detection with Pickit Flex.

Divide the scene into clusters & reject (some) clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The next step in the Pickit Flex detection is rather important. Here
the scene is divided into different parts (clusters). Each cluster
contains all points that belong to one object in the scene. All clusters
are shown in a different color. 

In the image below the effect of clustering is visualized. The 3D scene
is now divided into 7 different clusters (all shown in a different
color). Also it can be noted that the Clusters view contains less points
than the Points view. This is due to the user defined settings that
certain clusters are rejected. In this case smaller clusters are
rejected (not visualized in the image below). It makes sense to reject
smaller clusters because they often represent noise or partially covered
objects. Such clusters can be excluded in the **Reject clusters** step.

For the Flex detection to work properly every object should be clustered
apart. A bad example would be one cluster (color) for 2 parts in the
scene. The Pickit system supports different ways of clustering. All
methods are explained in the  :ref:`Explaining-the-flex-detection-parameters`.

Fit & filter objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The final step of Pickit Flex is to fit a certain geometric shape on
every cluster and to filter out the wrong objects. All accepted objects
can be sent to the robot one by one.

For each cluster that was accepted in the previous step now a shape is
fitted. In the image below we see that each cluster gives rise to a
object. Seven green cylinders and all points in the Region of Interest
are shown in the Objects view. 

In this last step it is decided which objects are accepted as good fits.
These good fits can then be sent back to the robot. Filtering of the
objects is done on their parameters shown in the  :ref:`detection-grid`.
An explanation of all these parameters can be found in the
article :ref:`Explaining-the-flex-detection-parameters`.
