Pick points in Pickit Teach
===========================

Once a Pickit Teach model :ref:`has been taught <teach-a-model>`, pick points need to be associated to it.
A pick point represents where an object can be picked by the robot.
It is specified as a position and orientation relative to the object, where the robot Tool Center Point (TCP) should move to perfrom a pick.
What constitutes a good pick point depends on both the gripping device and the object to be picked.

This article focuses on how pick points are created and managed, and the companion :ref:`smart picking examples <smart-picking-examples>` article describes how to make the best of it on real application scenarios.
The way in which an object is picked can also determine how to correctly place it at a drop-off location.
Refer to the :ref:`smart placing examples <smart-place-examples>` to learn more about useful and easy to program place strategies.

.. tip::
  If using a :ref:`cylinder model <teach-cylinder>`, the easiest way to create pick points is using the :ref:`pick points wizard <cylinder-pick-points-wizard>`.

.. _multiple-pick-points:

Multiple pick points per model
------------------------------

A single object can often be picked from more than one point. Having multiple pick points associated to a single Teach model has a two-fold advantage:

- Increase the likelihood that objects are pickable even if they overlap or are close to bin walls. Below, two possible pick points for picking a socket with a suction gripper are shown: the left one (in orange) is unpickabe due to collisions with the bin, while the right one (in green) is pickable.

- Specify pick points for models where only one part is visible at a time. This is the case for full object models :ref:`taught from CAD <teach-from-cad>`. Below, pick points for the top (left) and bottom (right) sides of a socket are shown.

.. tip::
  Apart from :ref:`multiple pick points <multiple-pick-points>`, other strategies that, if applicable, can increase the likelihood of an object being pickable, are :ref:`pick point symmetry axes <pick-point-symmetry-axis>`, and :ref:`flexible robot tool orientation <flexible-pick-orientation>`.

.. _pick-point-creation-management:

Pick point creation and management
----------------------------------

The **Define pick points** section of the :ref:`picking <Picking>` page allows to create and manage the pick points of Teach models:

- **Add pick point** creates a new pick point.
  Once created, a pick point can be enabled/disabled and its visibility can be toggled.
- :guilabel:`â‹®` **button**, provides acces to duplicating or deleting an existing pick point.
- :ref:`Select tool <robot-tool-model>`, sets the tool model to use for this pick point.
- :ref:`Point position and orientation <pick-point-location>`, sets the pick point location with respect to the object origin, or optionally with respect to an existing point by changing the :ref:`Reference point <pick-point-reference>`.
- :ref:`Priority <pick-point-priority>`, can be optionally set such that pick points with lower priority are considered only if higher priority ones are unpickable .
- :ref:`Symmetry axis <pick-point-symmetry-axis>`, can be optionally associated to the pick point. This is especially relevant for parts with axial symmetry .

.. _pick-point-selection:

Pick point selection
--------------------

When an object has multiple ways of being picked, Pickit smartly selects the best one to use.

.. details:: Click to expand and learn more about pick point selection.

  It does so by following these steps:

  1. **Sort the pick points** from highest to lowest. Note that this depends on how a particular object is oriented in the scene.

  2. **Go over the list of pick points** starting from the highest one.

    a. **Is the initial pick point pickable?** Determine the orientation that is closest to the :ref:`preferred pick point orientation <preferred-orientation-teach>`.
    If the tool model has :ref:`flexible pick orientation <flexible-orientation-at-pick-point>`, you can choose whether you prefer the initial pick to tilt less or point up as much as possible.
    If the initial pick point is pickable, use it to pick the object, else continue with the next step.

    b. **Is there a pickable configuration?** If the pick point has a :ref:`symmetry axis <pick-point-symmetry-axis>`, or the tool model has :ref:`flexible pick orientation <flexible-pick-orientation>`, search for a pickable configuration. The search will favor configurations that deviate as little as possible from the initial pick point from the previous step. If a pickable configuration is found, use it to pick the object, else continue with the next pick point.

  3. **No pickable points?** If no pickable point is found, the object is labeled as unpickable.

  .. tip::
    If you click on a particular detection in the :ref:`detection grid <detection-grid>`, you can learn which pick point was selected for picking. Also, if an object is unpickable, you can learn the reason why its pick points were not considered pickable.
