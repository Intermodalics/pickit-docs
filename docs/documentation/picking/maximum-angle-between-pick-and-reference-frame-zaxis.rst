.. _max_angle_pick_z_ref_z:

Maximum tilt from reference frame Z-axis
========================================

With this setting, you can specify the maximum angular difference
between the Z axis of your pick point and the Z axis of your :ref:`reference
frame <reference-frame>`. As seen in the image below, if an object is tilted more than the
maximum specified angle, the object will be labeled as unpickable and
not sent to the robot. In the Pickit web interface, unpickable objects
are displayed orange in the :ref:`Objects view <objects-view>` and the :ref:`detection-grid`.
