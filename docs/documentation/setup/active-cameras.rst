Active cameras
--------------

One Pickit processor can be connected to two different Pickit cameras at the same time. This can be two M-cameras, two L-cameras or a M and L-camera combined.

Here you select which camera to use in the setup file. Each setup file should have exactly one active camera.

.. note:: This option is only available if multiple cameras are connected to the processor.
