Fine-tune ROI box
-----------------

Once an initial ROI box has been defined, you can manually adjust its
size. When section **Fine-tune ROI box** is opened, in the **Setup** page,
colored arrows attached to the ROI are displayed in the viewer (in all
views except 2D). Arrows are colored according to the Pickit reference
frame direction: X→red, Y→green, Z→blue. You can interactively click and
drag the arrows to extend and contract the box along each of its sides.

The exact bounds and size of the ROI box are reported in the **Fine-tune ROI box** section,
as shown below. You can also manually set the bound
values here and the ROI box will be updated in the viewer.

.. note:: Only the size and position of ROI box can be changed, not the
   orientation. To change the orientation the ROI box needs to be defined
   again as described in the :ref:`build-roi-box` article.

Modify ROI box to remove the ground plane
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Removing the ground plane from the ROI box is one of the simplest ways
to have faster detection times. The below sequence shows
the **Points** view before and after raising the bottom of the box
just above the ground plane.

Bin representation with the ROI box
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use the ROI box as an approximate representation of the bin, we
recommend to define it :ref:`Use-markers`, and aligning
them with the bin corners. Once the initial ROI box is set with a
correct orientation, adjust the borders such that it excludes most bin
points, and includes all relevant bin contents. The below sequence shows
the **Points** view before and after adjusting the box boundaries to
the inside of the bin.
