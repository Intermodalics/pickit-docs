Test robot to Pick-it connection
================================

To test if Pick-it can connect to the robot through the Ethernet cable
you can perform the following test:

#. Press the **Settings** button on the top of the Pick-it interface;
#. Insert the **IP address of your robot** in the Robot IP field;
#. Push **Check**

A pop-up message indicating failure or **success** appears on the lower
right corner of the screen.Â \ |image0|

In case of failure, check if the cables are properly connected and
whether the IP assigned to the robot during the IP configuration step
matches the tested one.
