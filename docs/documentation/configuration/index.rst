Configuration
=============

On the configuration page, you can manage the setup and product files on
your Pick-it system.

-  **Setup** file: contains the Region of Interest (ROI) configuration,
   the camera selection, and the robot type.
-  **Product** file: contains the detection and picking parameters for a
   specific product.

The current loaded setup and product file are always shown in the top
bar as shown in the screenshot below.

Loading a setup or product file
-------------------------------

To load a new setup or product file just select them from the list. 

Setup and product files can also be loaded from within your robot
program using the correct Pick-it command.

You can download or delete a specific setup or product by pressing the
**Download** or \ **Delete** button once the setup or product files are
selected. Note that a setup or product file cannot be deleted while
being loaded.

.. warning::
  Deleted setup and product files cannot be recovered.

Creating a new setup or product file
------------------------------------

To create a new setup and product file, fill in the corresponding text
fields and click the  **Create** button. Pick-it will make a copy of the
current loaded setup and product and store them under the new name.
After creation, the new setup and product file will automatically be
loaded.

.. note::
  Setup and product properties can only be saved to the current
  configuration. Therefore, a new setup and/or product should be created
  or loaded **before** starting to configure a Pick-it application.
