Detection grid
--------------

The Pickit detection grid gives a clear overview of all detected
objects. In this way, you can see the dimensions, detection scores and a
lot more in a blink of an eye. 

Do you want to get even more details about every object? Then just click
on the individual object lines, like for object 5 below. 

On top of the grid, you can see a summary of all detected objects and
the detection time.
