Top bar
-------

Starting from left to right. First the logo of Pickit shown. Next to
the logo the name of the system is given, typically this is pc-XXXXX.
Next to the name the current software version of your system is shown.

Next are the Pickit connection status:

-  **Robot**: An active robot communication is indicated by **✓**,
   otherwise **∅**.
-  **Cam**: A camera connection is indicated by **✓**, otherwise **∅**.
-  **App**: The Pickit application correctly working is indicated by
   **✓**, otherwise **∅**.

Then the current operational mode is shown. The Pickit system has 4
main operational modes:

-  **Running**: Pickit is ready to receive commands from the robot and
   to send localization results to the robot. You can only run a robot
   program with Pickit when this state is activated. 
-  **Check**: Pickit is doing a single object detection without sending
   the result to a connected robot. This allows testing the object
   detection without any robot or machine connected. 
-  **Testing**: Pickit is continuously detecting objects without
   sending the result to a connected robot. This mode allows testing the
   object detection without any robot or machine connected. 
-  **Idle**: No commands from the robot are accepted.

.. note:: By default, Pickit enables the **Robot mode** upon startup.

Next to the state the current **Setup** and **Product** file are shown.
More information on these can be found in
the :ref:`_Configuration` article.

Then the Settings button is shown. Here the Network and user settings
can be defined. More information about these settings can be found in
the article :ref:`Settings`.

At last the **Robot mode** button is shown. Here you can change from
**Robot mode** to **Idle**. 

.. note:: Only when Pickit is in **Idle** mode parameters can be changed and
   saved.
