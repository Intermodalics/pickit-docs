Snapshots
=========

Pickit snapshots are a powerful tool for saving the results of a detection run.
Please refer to the :ref:`Saving-a-snapshot` article to learn more about them
and how they can be captured.

Pressing the :guilabel:`Snapshots` button of the Pickit web interface
:ref:`top bar <web-interface-top-bar>` takes you to a page where you can browse,
download and upload the snapshots of your Pickit system.
