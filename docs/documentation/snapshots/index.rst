Snapshots
=========

Pickit snapshots are a powerful tool for saving the results of a detection run.
Please refer to the :ref:`Saving-a-snapshot` article to learn more about them and how they can be captured.

Pressing the :guilabel:`Snapshots` button of the Pickit web interface :ref:`top bar <web-interface-top-bar>` takes you to a page where you can browse, download and upload the snapshots in your Pickit system.
You can also easily :ref:`share snapshots with the Pickit support team<Saving-a-snapshot>`.

Snapshots saved from a running robot program are saved in the subfolder **snapshots/robot**.
