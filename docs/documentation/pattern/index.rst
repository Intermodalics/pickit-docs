Pattern
=======

The Pickit Pattern engine is similar as the Flex detection
engine. Pattern looks for predefined sized objects(rectangles, squares,
circles,..).Â  This allows the Pattern detection engine to solve
applications beyond the limits of the Flex detection engine. A typical example
is touching aluminum blocks, see image below.
