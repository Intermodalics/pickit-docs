Robot-camera calibration
========================

In this step we do a robot-camera calibration. In the previous chapter
we saw that the Pickit system is able to detect parts in its field of
view. Now Pickit needs to know where the robot is based so that it can
tell the robot where it needs to move to when an object is detected.
**If you skip this step, the robot will move to a wrong location.**

Follow the steps below to do a robot-camera calibration:

-  Mount the robot-to-camera calibration plate to the flange of the
   robot. Make sure it is well fixed.
-  On the Pickit interface open the 2D view and the camera(s) tab. In
   this tab select Stationary and Multi poses calibration.
-  On your robot open the example multi pose calibration file supplied
   by Pickit
-  In this robot program define 5 different waypoints where the robot
   shows the robot-to-camera calibration plate to the camera.

-  Run the program on the robot.
-  In the Pickit user interface go to the 3D view and if the updated
   position of the robot base matches the actual position of the robot
   base.
-  Press Save in the Pickit user interface.
-  Robot-to-camera calibration plate can be dismounted from the robot.
