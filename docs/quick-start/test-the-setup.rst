Test the setup
==============

Now that every component is connected to the Pickit processor, we are
able to see Pickit's user interface:   

-  Open a Google Chrome web browser on your external PC and
   enter \ http://192.168.66.1 in the address bar.
-  Now the Pickit user interface is visible inside your web browser.

In the Pickit user interface the connection between the robot and the
processor can be checked:

-  Press the Settings button on the top of the Pickit interface.
-  Insert the IP address of your robot in the Robot IP field and press
   Check
-  A pop-up message indicating failure or success appears on the lower
   right corner of the screen.

.. note:: In case of failure, check if the cables are properly connected and
   whether the IP assigned to the robot during the IP configuration step
   matches the tested one.
