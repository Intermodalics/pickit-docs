Connect the cables
==================

In this step, we will connect all the cables to the Pickit processor.
Note that all the ports on the back of the Pickit processor are
correctly labeled. See the image below for an overview of all necessary
connections. Follow the steps below to connect the processor:

-  Connect the processor to the power outlet with the provided cable.
-  Connect the Pickit camera with the 10 m USB cable (CBL-USB-CAM-10)
   and plug it into the CAMERA labeled USB port at the back side of the
   Pickit processor. When the Pickit camera is connected correctly, a
   continuous green light is lit on front of the Pickit camera.

.. warning:: A USB hub is not allowed between the Pickit processor and
   camera connection.

-  Connect the gray/black 5 m UTP network cable (CBL-CAT6-GRAY-5
   / CBL-CAT6-BLACK-5) from your computer to the YOUR PC labeled RJ45
   port on the Pickit processor.
-  Connect the green 5 m UTP network cable (CBL-CAT6-GREEN-5) from your
   robot or machine controller with the ROBOT labeled RJ45 port at the
   back side of the Pickit processor.

.. tip:: The last step, the connection to a robot, is not necessary to
   already test the Pickit system.
